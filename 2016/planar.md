###### I

heart hurt head

night outside 

a car snoring

tap tap

smoke body blood

and glass and plastic

tapping tapping

you’re walking along a beach

pane slicing

###### II

i can feel the grass part

marsh–mallow wrinkle

licking

###### III

three tone metallic body

set with oil oiling on a line, 

single perspective, i turn my head to the east

an unfolding muscle

hairs standing, four tone patterned body

three three unfolding sheets, a muscle

vision of her — a vision of parting

three two one toned body, seven toned body

a cylinder unfolding,

ambling at a very slow pace, walking , changing surfaces, head to the east, three six tone body unfolding, pattern unfolding, a large and soft towel unfolding 

two paper, three, four

many eyes in procession

found
